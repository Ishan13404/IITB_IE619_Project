# Combinatorial Games

## About the Project

This repository contains implementations of two distinct combinatorial games: Cardisco and Oblique Outplay. These games are part of a course project for IE619 Combinatorial Game Theory at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) under Professor Urban Larrson from the Industrial Engineering and Operational Research (IEOR) department.

### About Impartial Games

Impartial games are a class of combinatorial games where both players have identical sets of moves available to them. The outcome depends solely on the positions and strategies of the players.

### About Cardisco

Cardisco is an impartial game played on a linear board with distinct moves for each player. The game revolves around making strategic moves to capture cards and avoid getting stuck.

### About Partisan Games

Partisan games, in contrast to impartial games, are games where the two players have distinct sets of moves available to them. Each player has their own set of options, and the choices of one player do not affect the options available to the other player.

### About Oblique Outplay

Oblique Outplay is a partisan game implemented here, played on a 5x5 grid with unique diagonal movement rules. Each player has their own set of tokens, and the goal is to outmaneuver the opponent by strategically moving your tokens forward.

## Installation

To play Cardisco, you need to have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install Python:**
   If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Pygame:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Pygame:
   
   ```shell
   pip install pygame

## How to Run the Game

1. For Cardisco, run the file named CardiscoGame.py.

2. For Oblique Outplay, run the file named ObliqueOutplayGame.py.

Additional logic for both games can be found in separate files for clarity and modularity.

## Game Rules
Detailed game rules can be found within the games. Refer to the help section inside each game for a comprehensive explanation of how to play and win.

Enjoy playing Cardisco and Oblique Outplay!
